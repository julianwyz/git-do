# git-do

`git-do` is an extension for `git` to make your commit hygiene even better.

## What does (g)it _do_?

Once installed, `git-do` adds a `do` subcommand to your `git` CLI. It connects to any Large Language Model API that conforms to the [OpenAI API Spec](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) to automate common git workflows.

This is the core motivation behind `git-do`. It integrates into your workflow to quickly and easily improve your git hygiene without getting in your way.
